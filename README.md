# Speil
An open-source, centralized and self-hosted remote desktop application.

"Speil" is norwegian for "mirror", which is fitting because what this software does is mirror another computers desktop, and allow you to interact with it.\
Software like Teamviewer already does this, but we should all have an alternative which offers better privacy, security and reliability.\
This is because I intend for this software to be used in low- to mid-grade industry environments.\
Support for Windows Server is not yet planned, unfortunately. But if it turns out that capturing its screen and displaying a GUI won't be a huge hassle, then that would be awesome!

I'd like to offer my thanks to [Rohan Sawant](https://github.com/CT83) who made [SmoothStream](https://github.com/CT83/SmoothStream), which made my job a lot easier.\
This project started as a fork of SmoothStream.
