# TODO:
- [ ] Combine Streamer and StreamViewer into a client.py file, with startup arguments determining whether to stream or view
- [x] Create a GUI to control such settings on the fly
- [x] Develop a system for sending commands between clients (Start, stop, mouse_event, keyboard_event, clipboard)
- [x] Create the centralized server which relays all traffic (stream + commands) between clients
